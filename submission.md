## What I learned about branching + merging (short paragraph)
I learned that short-lived feature branches keep changes focused and make code review easier. Merging into `dev` first helps catch integration issues early, and a final merge into `main` should be clean and predictable. Using clear branch names and small, reviewed PRs reduces conflicts and speeds up delivery.

## Git workflow 

- Summary: Created feature branches from `dev`, opened PRs for review, and used a final `dev` -> `main` merge for release.

## Features implemented 

- Summary: CRUD Operations, Task Descriptions + Metadata, Tags/Labels, Task Stats Dashboard, Kanban board, graph with progression, daily streak, Drag-and-drop task ordering and exporting to CSV or json.
